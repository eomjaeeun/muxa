//! **Internal:** this module's items are `#[doc(hidden)]` — they're
//! `pub` for the workspace binaries (`muxad`) but excluded from
//! the public API surface and semver-exempt.
//!
//! Periodic reconciliation against ground truth.
//!
//! The agent registry is event-driven: it accumulates state from hook
//! adapters, sync passes, and dashboard events, but has no inherent way to
//! discover that a pane has died, that a synthetic placeholder is no longer
//! authoritative, or that historical duplicates should be collapsed.
//! Without a reconciler the registry drifts over time — duplicate rows
//! pile up, ghost panes linger, and the picker view loses its 1:1
//! correspondence with the user's real tmux state.
//!
//! This module closes the loop by running a periodic, idempotent control
//! pass that treats tmux as the source of truth: observe → diff → converge,
//! the same shape as a Kubernetes controller. The reconciliation logic
//! itself lives on [`crate::state::Store::reconcile`]; this module is the
//! scheduler around it, plus the abstraction that makes it testable.
//!
//! ## Extensibility
//!
//! Liveness is fronted by the [`LivenessSource`] trait so the reconciler is
//! independent of tmux. Tests substitute a hand-rolled fake; future work
//! could plug in a multi-server tmux scanner, a screen/zellij adapter, or
//! a remote-host probe — all without touching `Reconciler` or `Store`.
