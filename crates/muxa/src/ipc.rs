//! Unix-domain-socket IPC.
//!
//! **Wire format.** Line-delimited JSON (one request per line, one
//! response per line). `serde_json` never emits newlines inside a value, so
//! embedded `\n` in strings is safely escaped — see the round-trip test.
//!
//! Every request carries a `protocol` field set to `PROTOCOL_VERSION`. The
//! server rejects mismatched versions to prevent schema drift from silently
//! corrupting state.
//!
//! **Socket permissions.** The server chmods the socket file to `0600` after
//! binding so only the owning user can send events.
//!
//! **Shutdown.** The server accepts a `CancellationToken`-style signal via
//! the `shutdown` channel and stops accepting new connections, then drains
//! its tracked in-flight handlers (with a bounded timeout) before
//! returning. The drain is what gives the snapshotter task its
//! "last-to-die" guarantee: by the time `Server::run` returns, no handler
//! can call `Store::apply` afterwards, so the daemon's final flush
//! captures every state change the user actually triggered.
